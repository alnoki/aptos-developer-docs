# Account Key Rotation

Aptos Move accounts have a public address, an authentication key, a public key,
and a private key. The public address is permanent, always matching the
account's initial authentication key, which is derived from the original private
key.

The Aptos account model facilitates the unique ability to rotate an account's
private key. Since an account's address is the _initial_ authentication key, the
ability to sign for an account can be transferred to another private key without
changing its public address.

In this guide, we show examples of how to rotate an account's authentication key
using the CLI and few of the various Aptos SDKs.

Here are the installation links for the SDKs we will cover in this example:

- [Aptos CLI](../cli.mdx)
- [Typescript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk.mdx)
- [Python SDK](../sdks/python-sdk.mdx)

<Callout type="warning">
Some of the following examples use private keys. Do not share your private
keys with anyone.
</Callout>

## Proven and unproven key rotations

The onchain logic for key rotation is implemented through two Move APIs:

1. [`account::rotate_authentication_key`], which executes a "proven" rotation.
1. [`account::rotate_authentication_key_call`], which executes an "unproven"
   rotation.

### Proven key rotations

The [`account::rotate_authentication_key`] API requires a signed
[`account::RotationProofChallenge`], which proves that the rotation operation is
approved by the private key from both before _and_ after the operation. When the
operation is successful, the [`account::OriginatingAddress`] table is updated
with an entry that maps from the new authentication key to the corresponding
account address.

The [`account::OriginatingAddress`] table is a reverse lookup table that allows
users to query an account address associated with a given authentication key,
and only allows for one entry per authentication key. Hence the requirement of a
signed [`account::RotationProofChallenge`] to ensure that a malicious actor does
not rotate an account's authentication key to a key that is already in the
table, as this attack that would prevent lookup of the valid originating address
that the holder of an authentication key had previously approved.

Notably, the [`account::OriginatingAddress`] table is _only_ updated upon key
rotation, not upon standard account generation. This means that with proven key
rotations, a given private key can theoretically authenticate up to two accounts
at the same time:

1. The account address derived from the private key during standard account
   generation, assuming the account has not undergone any key rotations.
1. A second arbitrary address, which has had its authentication key rotated to
   the given private key.

However, it is considered best practice to only authenticate _one_ account with
a given private key at a time, because whenever the
[`account::OriginatingAddress`] table is updated, the underlying logic first
checks if the rotating account's initial authentication key is in the table, and
if so, verifies that the rotating account's address is the one mapped to in the
table.

This means that if an arbitary account's authentication key is rotated to
a given private key, the standard account whose address is originally derived
from the private key will not be able to execute its first authentication key
rotation while the associated authentication key is mapped to a second arbitrary
account address in the [`account::OriginatingAddress`] table, because this
operation would fail the check that the rotating account's address is the one
mapped to in the table (since the table is only updated upon during rotation,
not upon standard account generation).

### Unproven key rotations

Unlike [`account::rotate_authentication_key`], the
[`account::rotate_authentication_key_call`] does _not_ require a signed
[`account::RotationProofChallenge`]. This means that the operation is not proven
in the sense the the private key from _after_ the operation has approved the
key rotation. Hence the [`account::OriginatingAddress`] table is _not_ updated
for unproven key rotations, and there is thus no restriction on the number of
accounts that can be authenticated with a given private key. Note that the
`aptos` CLI does not currently support unproven key rotations.

<Callout type="default" emoji="ðŸ§ ">
The [`account::rotate_authentication_key_call`] was introduced to support
non-standard key algorith, like passkeys, which cannot produce proofs of
knowledge during rotation operations.

## Key rotation with the Aptos CLI

<Steps>

### Initialize devnet profiles

Run the following to initialize test profiles. Leave the inputs blank each time
you're prompted for a private key.

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos init --profile test-profile-1 --network devnet --assume-yes
aptos init --profile test-profile-2 --network devnet --assume-yes
aptos init --profile test-profile-3 --network devnet --assume-yes
```

### Get private key

To view `test-profile-2` with its private key hidden:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-2
```

To show the profile's private key:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-private-key --profile test-profile-2
```

<Callout type="default" emoji="ðŸ§ ">
If your machine has `jq`, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON
processor, you can pipe the private key directly into an environment variable:

```bash filename="Terminal"
export TEST_PROFILE_2_PRIVATE_KEY=$(
    aptos config show-private-key --profile test-profile-2 \
        | jq -r '.Result'
)
echo $TEST_PROFILE_2_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Otherwise, manually copy and paste:

```bash filename="Terminal"
export TEST_PROFILE_2_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```
</Callout>

### Rotate authentication key

Rotate the account address associated with `test-profile-1` to authenticate via
the private key from `test-profile-2` private key:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos account rotate-key \
    --new-private-key $TEST_PROFILE_2_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --profile test-profile-1 \
    --save-to-profile test-profile-1-rotated
```

Once the transaction completes, compare the profiles:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-1
aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-1-rotated
aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-2
```

Note that `test-profile-1` has a different public key from
`test-profile-1-rotated`, which has the same public key as `test-profile-2`.
This is because `test-profile-1` is an outdated representation of the account
that is now accurately represented by `test-profile-1-rotated`, which is
authenticated via the same private key as `test-profile-2`.

<Callout type="default" emoji="ðŸ§ ">
If your machine has `jq`, you can easily compare the public keys via:

```bash filename="Terminal"
export PROFILE_1_PUB_KEY=$(
    aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-1 \
        | jq -r '.Result["test-profile-1"].public_key'
)
export PROFILE_1_ROTATED_PUB_KEY=$(
    aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-1-rotated \
        | jq -r '.Result["test-profile-1-rotated"].public_key'
)
export PROFILE_2_PUB_KEY=$(
    aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-2 \
        | jq -r '.Result["test-profile-2"].public_key'
)
echo $PROFILE_1_PUB_KEY
echo $PROFILE_1_ROTATED_PUB_KEY
echo $PROFILE_2_PUB_KEY
```
</Callout>

### Compare authentication keys listed onchain

First you'll need to get the account addresses. Note that `test-profile-1` and
`test-profile-1-rotated` have the same account address.

<Callout type="default" emoji="ðŸ§ ">
If your machine has `jq`, you can easily store account addresses via the
following:

```bash filename="Terminal"
export TEST_ADDRESS_1=$(
    aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-1 \
        | jq -r '.Result["test-profile-1"].account'
)
export TEST_ADDRESS_2=$(
    aptos config show-profiles --profile test-profile-2 \
        | jq -r '.Result["test-profile-2"].account'
)
echo $TEST_ADDRESS_1
echo $TEST_ADDRESS_2
```

Otherwise, you'll need to re-run the `show-profiles` commands from the last step
and manually copy the addresses:

```bash filename="Terminal"
export TEST_ADDRESS_1=0x...
export TEST_ADDRESS_2=0x...
```
</Callout>

To view the authentication keys of the two accounts onchain:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move view \
    --args address:0x$TEST_ADDRESS_1 \
    --function-id 0x1::account::get_authentication_key \
    --profile test-profile-1
aptos move view \
    --args address:0x$TEST_ADDRESS_2 \
    --function-id 0x1::account::get_authentication_key \
    --profile test-profile-1
```

Note that `--profile test-profile-1` is repeated across both calls since in this
case the profile is only used to specify the REST URL for the query.

### Inspect lookup addresses

The onchain originating address table is a reverse lookup table that maps from
an authentication key to an account address.

The originating address table is only updated upon key rotation, and maps from
an authentication key to at most _one_ account address, which means that
theoretically a given private key can authenticate up to two accounts at the
same time:

1. The account address derived from the private key during standard account
   generation, assuming the account has not undergone any key rotations
   (`test-profile-2`).
1. A second arbitrary address, which has had its authentication key rotated to
   the given private key (`test-profile-1-rotated`).

The command `aptos account lookup-address` checks if a there is an entry in the
originating address table for a given private key, and if so, returns the
reverse lookup address. If not, it simply returns the account address derived
from the private key, hence the following commands all return `TEST_ADDRESS_1`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos account lookup-address --profile test-profile-1
aptos account lookup-address --profile test-profile-2
aptos account lookup-address --profile test-profile-1-rotated
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
echo $TEST_ADDRESS_1
```

This is because the private key in `test-profile-1` doesn't have a corresponding
authentication key entry in the originating address able, while the private key
that authenticates both `test-profile-2` and `test-profile-1-rotated` _does_
have a corresponding entry, which maps to `TEST_ADDRESS_1` due to the key
rotation.

### Attempt invalid rotations

Since the private key that authenticates `test-profile-2` and
`test-profile-1-rotated` is now in the originating address table, it is not
possible to perform a key rotation operation that rotates either _to_ the
corresponding authentication key, or _from_ the corresponding authentication
key for an account besides `TEST_ADDRESS_1`.

For example, `test-profile-2` may not be rotated to authenticate with the
private key of `test-profile-1` (rotate from the authentication key for an
account other than `TEST_ADDRESS_1`):

<Callout type="default" emoji="ðŸ§ ">
If your machine has `jq`, you can pipe the private key of `test-profile-1`
directly into an environment variable:

```bash filename="Terminal"
export TEST_PROFILE_1_PRIVATE_KEY=$(
    aptos config show-private-key --profile test-profile-1 \
        | jq -r '.Result'
)
echo $TEST_PROFILE_1_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Otherwise, manually copy and paste:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-private-key --profile test-profile-1
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
export TEST_PROFILE_1_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```
</Callout>

Attempt an invalid rotation from `TEST_ADDRESS_2`, which is authenticated by the
private key that also authenticates `TEST_ADDRESS_1`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos account rotate-key \
    --new-private-key $TEST_PROFILE_1_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --profile test-profile-2 \
    --save-to-profile test-profile-2-rotated
```

This command fails because the underlying Move logic for key rotation expects
that the originating address table maps from the given authentication key to the
address that is rotating its authentication key, which is not the case here
(because the table was initialized with an entry mapping to `TEST_ADDRESS_1`,
not `TEST_ADDRESS_2`):

Similarly, it is not possible to rotate a different account address to the
private key that authenticates `test-profile-2` and `test-profile-1-rotated`
(rotate to authentication key that is already in the originating address table):

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos account rotate-key \
    --new-private-key $TEST_PROFILE_2_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --profile test-profile-3 \
    --save-to-profile test-profile-3-rotated
```

Hence it is best practice to only authenticate _one_ account with a given
private key at a time.

### Delete the test profiles

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos config delete-profile --profile test-profile-1
aptos config delete-profile --profile test-profile-2
aptos config delete-profile --profile test-profile-1-rotated
aptos config delete-profile --profile test-profile-3
```
